To edit text on any page,

To change images on any page:

1. Use the image folder icon at the top of the editor to upload the image you want to add in. 
   Take note of the name of the image, including any spaces and capitalization.

2. Make sure to switch Markdown ON (right side at top of editor)

3. Locate the image tag within the page. It should look like this ![image-description](image-path).
   If you see curly braces {} with text in them, DO NOT edit any of the text inside of the curly braces.
   This text is necessary for styling of the webpage.

4. Change the text inside of the brackets [] to a short description of your image.

5. Change to pathname inside of the parentheses () to the following: /images/my-image.jpg
   Make sure to replace "my-image.jpg" with the name of your image, including the appropriate file extension (jpg, png, etc.)

6. The pathname must include an exact match of your image name, including capitalization. If your image name
   contains spaces, replace each space with %20. For example, if you are adding an image called Airplane Image.jpg,
   your pathname would be /images/Airplane%20Image.jpg and the entire image tag would be as follows:
   ![Image of an Airplane](/images/Airplane%20Image.jpg).

7. Click save at the bottom right hand corner of the page. You should see your changes reflected on the live site within a few minutes.
